Introduction: 
This is a Simulink model for DC motor speed control where the PID controller is being tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO) in MATLAB. This setup is designed for efficient speed control and can be applied to research in electric drives, particularly in optimizing controller parameters.
Features: 
PID Controller Tuning: The controller parameters are tuned using PSO for optimal performance.
DC Motor Simulation: Models real-world DC motor dynamics for accurate speed control.
Customizable Parameters: You can easily modify the motor and controller settings for experimentation.
Research Focus: Ideal for projects involving electric drives and control systems optimization.
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open MATLAB and Simulink.
Load the Simulink model from the repository.
Adjust the PSO algorithm parameters if needed (number of particles, iterations, etc.).
Run the simulation to observe the speed control results.
